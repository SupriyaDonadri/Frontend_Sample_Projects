        I'm Supriya, currently working as a Backend Developer at Imaginnovate.
        This is my first company, and I have gained 1 year of experience in
        backend development so far. Now, I am excited to start learning frontend
        technologies as well, with the goal of becoming a Full Stack Developer.
        Wish me luck on this journey!
